== Description ==

**A free tool, exclusive to Agoda Affiliates**

Text links are the best and most proven way to drive high-converting traffic to your booking pages. Which is why we’re making it easy for you to update your text links today and maintain maximum monthly bookings by monetizing your existing and new blog posts.

**The Old-to-New Agoda Link Converter** is a simple plug-in that instantly converts old affiliate link structures to new link structures and automatically converts popular destination keywords to Agoda affiliate links.

**New links are better than old ones**
We’ve improved the Agoda affiliate link structure to:
* **Provide stronger tracking**, by running all traffic through a proxy server that provides a secure place for measurement and data protection
* **Improve conversion** by linking to live-optimized landing pages, such as a top search results page instead of an underperforming city page

**Popular destinations become perfect accommodation**
The Old-to-New Agoda Link Converter lets you monetize both existing and new travel blogs posts by automatically converting popular destination keywords, such as city names, into live Agoda affiliate links that precisely target customers by connecting engaging destination content to the perfect accommodation for enjoying it.
